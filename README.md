heka-encoder-filter
===================

A filter for [Mozilla Heka](http://hekad.readthedocs.org/) that does nothing but encode the payload.

A use case for this would be anytime multiple encodings are required for the payload

This Filter should probably not exist but since there is currently no other mechanism within heka that allow for multiple encodings i.e. MultiEncoder, Mutate? this will have to do.
